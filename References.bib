@article{McHenry:2023aa,
	abstract = {Rural transport presents many challenges but understanding the patterns of mobility in rural areas is a first step towards addressing them. A Mobility Index (MI) combining indicators to create a single score for each place can help do this. This paper examines the development of a MI for rural centres in the west of Ireland. In general, MIs are urban-focused so this is an innovation for rural towns. The MI was divided into three key themes for which good mobility is essential: employment and economic opportunities; access to services and social facilities; and readiness for the low carbon transition. The MI allows comparison between places, across different objectives and enables the monitoring of changes taking place over time. While this MI was developed for rural towns in the west of Ireland, the concept and many of the elements of its construction are transferrable to other regions.},

@inproceedings{Reynolds:2017ah,
	abstract = {There is wide agreement that prioritising on-road public transport services is beneficial, but considerable uncertainty about how best to implement priority measures in practice. As yet it is unclear why some transit priority schemes receive political, institutional and public support while others are blocked, cancelled or compromised, often for non-technical reasons. This paper explores how public policy analysis concepts can be adapted to describe and potentially improve transit priority implementation. Previous evaluation approaches have focused on the traffic, mobility and economic impacts of transit priority measures. What has been missing is a consideration of how politics, institutional arrangements and other non-rational factors influence priority implementation. This paper describes the major forms of policy analysis (rationalism, institutionalism, incrementalism, political approaches and the `garbage can' model) and uses each to develop new conceptual models of priority implementation. Institutional and top-down models emphasise the government's control over the road and transit system. They suggest that better policies and centralisation of decision-making might improve priority implementation. In contrast, bottom-up implementation theories and what is termed the `garbage can' model emphasise the influence of street-level actors and project team members. These suggest that understanding the drivers of individuals' opinions, strategies and decision-making is necessary to improve implementation and outcomes. Incrementalism based models, on the other hand, suggest using a series of small changes to gradually increase the level of transit priority over time instead of a large, and potentially controversial, single step. This paper provides an initial move beyond the prevailing `techno-rationalist' approaches to transit priority implementation. It concludes with a description of opportunities for future research to test these new models and to explore the political, institutional and other factors influencing transit priority implementation},

@techreport{Litman:2016aa,
	abstract = {This report describes a framework for determining when bus lanes are warranted based on economic efficiency, social equity and strategic planning objectives. Bus lanes increased urban transport system efficiency and equity by favoring higher value trips and more space-efficient modes over lower-value trips and space-intensive modes. Bus lanes can carry more passengers than general traffic lanes, and so increase total capacity (people per traffic lane), increase transit system operating efficiency, directly benefit bus passengers, cause travellers to shift from automobile to transit which reduces various transportation problems, and support more transit-oriented development. This paper examines how these impacts are considered in conventional planning, describes examples of bus lane planning and evaluation, and discusses ways to optimize their implementation. Much of this analysis also applies to other transit improvements, such as increased service frequency, and other managed lane types such as HOV and HOT lanes. This paper should be of interest to policy analysts, transport planners and engineers, and transit advocates.},

Building on consolidated methodologies for the assessment of potential accessibility, we estimate accessibility indicators at the zone level, evaluate how potential accessibility varies among income groups, and present evidence related to transport mode, in order to analyze social and spatial inequalities produced by the distribution of accessibility to employment and education activities. The research incorporates a method to evaluate how accessibility varies among zones according to average income and mode of transport in order to produce evidence-based arguments that can inform transport policy in the city-region of Bogot{\'a}, and other similar contexts in the Global South. Our results show strong distributional effects of the socio-spatial and economic structure of the city-region, its transport infrastructure and services, and the effect of current transport and land-use policies for citizens of different income groups. The tools and empirical evidence in this research seek to contribute to informed policy development in Latin America and other developing contexts, and feeding current debates on the role of accessibility in addressing social and spatial inequalities stemming from urban mobility.},

@article{KetokiviMikko2014Rocr,
	abstract = {Since the seminal article by Eisenhardt (1989), scholarly interest in case research has mushroomed in operations management and organization sciences. Volumes of methodological texts are matched with a massive amount of empirical research that seeks to apply and further develop case research as a scientific method. What is missing from this literature is a treatment of the methodological diversity of case research. In this paper, we seek to unveil this heterogeneity by describing three distinct methodological accounts of case study: theory generation, theory testing, and theory elaboration. Each approach has its own idiosyncrasies, in particular when it comes to the interplay between theory and empirics. A typical case research incorporates both existing theories and empirical data to varying degrees. In light of this heterogeneity, we re-interpret key aspects of extant contributions and discuss guidelines for future case research. We propose that ultimately, case research rigor is determined by attention to idiosyncrasy and transparency of reasoning. We conclude by arguing that we have witnessed in the past 25 years in organization research what amounts to the Renaissance of case research.},

	abstract = {The public transport system plays an important role in a city as it moves people from one place to another efficiently and economically. The public transport network must be organized in a way that will cover as many places and as much of the population as possible, and support the city's growth. As one of Australia's largest capital cities, Melbourne is growing and expanding its metropolitan area to reflect the growth in population and an increased number of activities. To date, little research has been conducted to determine the accessibility and adequacy of public transport taking into consideration the blank spot areas, the number of public transport options for each area, the population density within specific geographical areas, and other issues. In this study, a new measurement model is developed that examines public transport in residential areas and the extent to which it is adequate for the various local government areas (LGAs). An accessibility approach is adopted to evaluate the accessibility of different types of public transportation in residential areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The results show that in most LGAs, the number of blank spots will decrease as the population density increases. This indicates that residents in lower-density areas will have less accessibility to public transportation. However, there is no indication that there is a greater level of services (such as more night-time and weekend public transportation services) in the high-density areas. This research is significant as it will point to and help to improve the areas with inadequate public transportation and other issues, taking into consideration their geographical locations and population density.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new approach to assessing the performance of public transport networks in meeting the needs of transport disadvantaged people in the community. It describes how the approach has been developed and applied using Hobart Tasmania as a study area. The approach aims to identify gaps in the public transport network where travel needs are high but services are poor or non-existent. It involves the use of readily available socio-economic statistics to quantify the distribution of needs in the community. A public transport network model identifies the quality of service offered by the public transport system to these groups and a Geographical Information Systems approach is used to display the distribution of gaps between service and needs which are identified. The technique is highly relevant for cities where the justification of public transport subsidies is largely social needs based, that is where congestion and environmental benefits of transit are less critical.

@article{Pavkova2016,
	abstract = {Road and public transport authorities often have a difficult task in deciding which road links to select for investment in preferential traffic and public transport measures to improve public transport service performance. This paper presents a new approach which adopts the economic concept of the Lorenz Curve to compare link performance in terms of transit operations as well as weighted passenger volume of travel. The paper explores if, and how, these metrics can be re-interpreted to help with targeting improvements for on-road public transport and priority mitigations. The approach collates operational performance data, in this case link speed and also link public transport travel volume to plot the cumulative distribution of link speed/ridership performance as a curve. Two sets of test applications are presented; on a route level basis and secondly a network level analysis. The network level results present the most powerful results with the Lorenz Curve analysis able to quickly identify links that justify greater attention for preferential treatments since they have the worst 20th percentile of operational performance but the highest 40th percentile of relative link ridership. Mapping shows the problem links to be busy routes leading into the central city. Implications for wider application of these methods are discussed.},

However, who is to be served and the type of service that should be provided has been ambiguous. This paper develops a methodology for examining equity in the provision of public transportation services. An approach for identifying areas in need of public transport is developed based upon the use of socio-demographic and economic information. Public transport need is then related to levels of access to service. This approach makes it possible to establish the degree to which public transport services may be considered equitable in relation to need and suitable access. A detailed analysis of the southeast Queensland region of Australia illustrates how this approach may be used to inform public transport decision making. Copyright 2001 Blackwell Publishers},

A GIS-based land use and public transport accessibility indexing model has been developed for measuring and mapping levels of accessibility to basic community services by walking and/or public transport, within local government areas. The model aims to assist the planning and decision making process to deliver integrated land use and transportation outcomes. It is an origin-based accessibility model that determines levels of accessibility by utilising GIS analysis techniques to measures accessibility based on both actual walking distances and public transport travel time. The model has been applied to two pilot studies in the Gold Coast City to assess its practicality and effectiveness. This paper outlines the methodology of the model and the findings related to these pilot studies. The paper also demonstrates benefits and application of the model to other urbanised local government areas.},

	abstract = {Transport affordability stresses have been acknowledged as a principle concern of transport disadvantage in Australian cities. Transport poverty is a term which has been used to describe low income households who have a little choice but to purchase and use cars to maintain a reasonable lifestyle in mainly fringe urban locations with no transport alternatives and poor walk accessibility. These households have been said to demonstrate lforced car ownershipr (FCO) however evidence suggest the degree of coercion involved is low, but affordability stresses which result are high. Forced car ownership has not been systematically reviewed since the 2001 census. This paper explores the extent to which FCO has changed between the 2001 and the most recent 2011 census. The analysis shows a 93 per cent increase in FCO households in outer Melbourne between 2001 and 2011. Most increases have been in areas with poor access to public transport or walk accessibility alternatives. Highest growth rates have occurred in outer western, northern and south-eastern fringe and middle Melbourne. The most pressing policy implication of these changes is that a greater proportion of low income Melbourne residents are vulnerable to financial shocks associated with potential future increases in fuel prices. The obvious implication of this analysis is that fringe Melbourne is facing a potential transport poverty crisis.},

The need for transit service was then modeled as the lack of transit accessibility, and the model correlated different access indicators with their ability to predict transit service need. This model mapped areas with different levels of transit accessibility and transit needs by using a single score, which may be easily interpreted by planners who examine transit equity. The model was applied to the city of Meriden, Connecticut, and results were compared with a general approach for consistency and effectiveness. The usefulness of the model was also highlighted through a representative example of the model's application.},

@article{Lei2010Mapping,
	abstract = {Accessibility is a concept that is not entirely easy to define. Gould (1969) once stated that it is a `slippery notion {\ldots} one of those common terms that everyone uses until faced with the problem of defining and measuring it'. Considerable research over the last 40 years has been devoted to defining and measuring accessibility, ranging from access to jobs within an hour's travel time to the ease at which given places can be reached. This article is concerned with the measurement of access provided by transit. It includes a review of past work on measuring accessibility in general and with respect to transit services in particular. From this overview of the literature, it can be seen that current methods fall short in measuring transit service access in several meaningful aspects. Based on this review and critique, we propose new refinements that can be used to help overcome some of these shortcomings. As a part of this, we define an extended GIS data structure to handle temporal elements of transit service. To demonstrate the value of these new measures, examples are presented with respect to mapping accessibility of transit services in Santa Barbara, California. Finally, we show how these measures can be used to develop a framework for supporting transit service analysis and planning.},

@article{Wee2011Discussing,
	abstract = {Ex ante evaluations of transport policy options (including infrastructure plans) are generally based on cost-benefit analyses (CBA). Accessibility changes are included in such analyses indirectly, via a utilitarian perspective. But accessibility is broader than is assumed by this perspective and also incorporates equity and related distribution effects as well as social exclusion. This paper aims to give an overview of the relevance of distribution effects and equity, and social exclusion for accessibility, based on the literature. The most important conclusions of our paper is that the two subjects are poorly addressed in transport appraisal in general, and in CBA in particular. Additional ethical theories could add value to the utilitarian perspective, egalitarian theories being a major competitor. Equity analysis is however complex because there are several types of equity, various ways to categorize people for equity analysis, numerous impacts to consider, and various ways of measuring these impacts. And such analysis requires normative judgements, in addition to simply presenting distribution effects. Several options are available to express distribution effects. Important choices to be made if such effects need to be reported relate to the unit of comparison (e.g. the household versus the individual), the indicator to be used, and the value of each unit to be compared (e.g. accessibility) for all units of comparison (e.g. households). We also conclude that CBA is not suitable for evaluating social exclusion policies. Based on this overview we propose an agenda for potential future research in the area of ethics and accessibility.},

It reviews previous and current research in this area and describes how a new approach has been developed and applied with Hobart, Australia, as a study area. The approach aims to identify geographical gaps in public transport provision where travel needs are high but services are poor or nonexistent. It involves the use of readily available socioeconomic statistics to quantify the distribution of needs in the community with a single transport needs index. A public transport network model measures the public transport accessibility to these groups and a geographical information systems approach is used to display the distribution of the identified gaps between service and needs. The technique is highly relevant for smaller urban centers where the justification of public transport subsidies is largely social-needs-based---that is, where congestion and environmental benefits of transit are less critical. It is also relevant to recent work in transport accessibility audits and in the assessment of community impacts of alternative transit development strategies.},

The result is fresh theory that bridges well from rich qualitative evidence to mainstream deductive research. This is the hallmark of building from case studies.},

@article{Jang2017Assessing,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology for calculating the index of the spatial equity for the public transportation services for the city of Seoul using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient based on accessibility to the services. The index was estimated for 100 m × 100 m cells first and then aggregated for 424 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the city. The indices for Seoul's subway and bus were represented with and without the weighting factor. On the basis of this methodology, this study assessed the effect of an additional subway line on the spatial equity before and after its operation. Furthermore, an index of relative difference indicating the change in population and employment in the station areas was applied to investigate the changed effects of spatial equity between population and employment from the new subway line. The core findings from this research are summarized as follows. First, the subway network of Seoul provides more unequal public transportation services for the TAZs than for the bus network. Second, an improvement in the operation frequency of both transit modes would deepen the spatial inequity of Seoul. Third, a subway extension plan for Seoul could noticeably reduce the spatial inequity. The plan would improve the spatial equity for the population more than that for employment. The most important meaning of this study is to be found in combining spatial equity on the supply side with transit-oriented development (TOD) on the demand side. So, by establishing a TOD policy for the additional subway station areas, an appropriate land-use pattern can be established for maximizing potential ridership in consideration of the combination.},

@article{Wong:2013aa,
	abstract = {Since 2007, the transit industry has benefited from a widely adopted data standard called the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), which has enabled the development of numerous traveler information tools (i.e., transit trip planners). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the potential for GTFS feeds as a data source for transit analyses, such as those found in the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual. There are three primary project tasks: an analysis of GTFS field usage by different agencies an analysis of a single agency's operations at the stop, route, and system levels and a batch analysis and comparison of 50 large transit agencies in North America. Compared with manually transcribing schedules from transit websites or parsing printed schedules, the use of scripts and database queries suggests that the GTFS is a highly efficient data source and proves the importance of broadly accepted data standards. The methodology documented in this paper and the open source scripts (made available online) will be useful for any analyst or researcher who has tasks related to the analysis of single or multiple transit systems at the stop, route, or system level.},
